# Eye of Sauron

This is the Eye of Sauron repo. It contains proof of concept code for a kernel level keylogger. This was done for learning purposes only, and is not intended to be used for anything else. Also there's no warranty.

I was intending to release this after my NolaCon 2020 talk, but due to 2020 the conference was cancelled. I debated on resubmitting the talk for next year, and I still might since very few people will see this here. Part of me also wanted to release this because I am very proud of this code. There are still plenty of areas for improvements, and indeed, if anyone cares enough feel free to drop a pull request and I'll see what we can do. Another part of me thinks that I've spent enough time on this and it might be time to move on to another project.

We'll see where the rest of 2020 and beyond takes us!
